# Acronis Backup Auditor

#### This script allows you to determine whose backups are out of date, allowing you to easily customize what the duration between backups should be considered as out of date. 

##### You only need to add your api key to the JSON and edit the threshold value and limit values at the top of the file, threshold is days til considered out of date, and limit is the amouunt of rows to be returned (How many computers you have, it can be higher than what you actually have, but lower will obviously not report all computers)
